In number theory, Bertand's postulate is the theorem that for any integer n > 3, ther exist at least one prime number p with
n < p < 2n-2

My theorem is that for any integer n > 3 and $n < p_n^2$ and $n < n+2*(p_{n-1} - 1) + 1$, ther exist at least one prime number p with

$n \leq p \leq n+2*(p_{n-1} - 1) + 1$
